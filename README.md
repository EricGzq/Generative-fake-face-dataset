# GFF-dataset
The GFF datase is built by exploiting the Glow model and the CelebA face image dataset. 

# Overview
Glow is a generative model for facial expression synthesis, which can change face attributes. We use Glow model and CelebA dataset to build a large fake face datasett, which contains more than 320k face images. The dataset will soon be released here for researchers to use.
